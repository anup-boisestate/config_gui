# InletVelocities requires three floating point values separated by spaces.
# These values apply to Inlet and LogarithmicInlet boundary conditions. With 
# the LogarithmicInlet, it is only used to determine the angle of the flow so
# magnitude does not matter.  The magnitude is found from the FrictionVelocity.
# Note: These are signed vectors, negative is west/south

# The perturbation cell turbulent inflow conditions (first proposed by 
# Munoz-Esparza et al. 2014) applies random perturbations to groups of 
# temperature grid cells referred to as perturbation cells. These
# perturbation cells need their length, width and height defined with
# PerturbBoxLength, PerturbBoxWidth and PerturbBoxHeight, respectively.
# The number of perturbation cells from the inflow is defined by the
# PerturbZoneDepth tag as an integer value.
# The perturbation amplitude is defined by PerturbZoneRichardson.
# The perturbation cell method is activated by setting a boundary to an
# inlet and setting PerturbTurbInflow to True.
# Note: PerturbBoxLength, PerturbBoxWidth and PerturbBoxHeight can
# be set to the strings dx, dy and dz, respectively as a shortcut to
# set the perturbation dimensions equal to the grid spacing.
